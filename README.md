**AI-Based Cyber Threat Detection**

The Express app opens to an XAI-CyberShield security dashboard. Its threat rows and chart totals are representative demo data; blocking/allowing an IP changes only the dashboard state and does not configure a firewall. Dataset selection stays in the browser and does not train or upload a model.

**Run the dashboard**

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000`. A reachable MongoDB instance is needed for the existing authentication API; the dashboard itself can be viewed without a database connection.

For local configuration, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set a private, randomly generated `JWT_SECRET`. Do not commit `.env`.

**📌 Project Overview**

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered Cyber Threat Detection System that analyzes network traffic in real-time, detects anomalies, and classifies potential cyber threats using machine learning techniques.

With the growing number of cyberattacks like Brute Force, SQL Injection, XSS, and DDoS, traditional rule-based systems are often insufficient. Our system leverages AI and ML models to detect both known and unknown (zero-day) attacks with high accuracy.

This project was developed as part of my Final Year Software Development Project (SDP).

**🎯 Objectives**

🔎 Detect and classify cyber threats in real-time using AI models

📡 Automate network traffic analysis to identify malicious behavior

🧠 Implement anomaly detection for unusual patterns not caught by static rules

📊 Provide an admin dashboard for monitoring, visualization, and alerts

🛡️ Enable proactive defense against common attack vectors

**⚙️ System Architecture**

**1. Data Collection Layer**

Captures network traffic logs, IP addresses, login attempts, and requests

Stores structured data for analysis

**2. Preprocessing Layer**

Cleans and normalizes data

Extracts features like request frequency, payload patterns, session duration, protocol type

**3. AI/ML Detection Engine**

Uses Supervised and Unsupervised ML models (Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks)

Implements anomaly detection for unknown attack patterns

Detects threats such as Brute Force, SQL Injection, XSS, and DDoS

**4. Response & Alerting Layer**

Generates real-time alerts for admins

Blocks malicious IP addresses automatically

Logs detected threats for further analysis

**5. Dashboard (Frontend)**

Built with React/Next.js + TailwindCSS

Provides visualizations for threat statistics, attack breakdown, and real-time monitoring

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Frontend: React.js / Next.js, TailwindCSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL

AI/ML Models: Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization: Chart.js / D3.js / Recharts

Security: Secure APIs, SSL/TLS, Firewall rules

Hosting: Heroku / Vercel / Self-hosted server

**📊 Features**

✔️ Real-time threat detection with AI models

✔️ Automatic malicious IP blocking

✔️ Visualization dashboard for monitoring

✔️ Threat classification (SQLi, XSS, brute force, etc.)

✔️ Admin alerts & notifications

✔️ Scalable and modular design

**🔬 Dataset**

Datasets Used: NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017, and custom log data

Preprocessing: Extracted features like packet size, protocol, request rate, session time

Balanced Dataset: Applied sampling techniques to handle class imbalance

**🚀 Results**

✅ Achieved 85–95% accuracy depending on attack type

✅ Successfully detected SQL Injection & XSS payloads using NLP-based payload analysis

✅ Reduced false positives with anomaly detection

✅ Provided real-time visualization of threats through an admin dashboard

**📌 Future Enhancements**

🔗 Integration with SIEM tools for enterprise deployment

🤖 Use of Deep Reinforcement Learning for adaptive defense

🌐 Extend coverage to IoT network attacks

☁️ Deploy on cloud platforms for large-scale traffic monitoring
